Everything Minecraft related. Authentication, Launching and much more!  

## Ely.by - FortressAPI
Since Bastion's beginning, we have always trusted and developed on [Ely.by](https://ely.by).  
FortressAPI is now under the MCLib project, and Ely.by support will now be stronger than ever, and we aim to provide more tools and libraries for it.  
  
Currently, [Ely.by API](https://docs.ely.by/en/api.html) and [Authentication for Minecraft](https://docs.ely.by/en/minecraft-auth.html) is completed.  
Exceptions are also implemented for incorrect credentials.
